# Taxi-Fare-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting taxi fares based on various input features such as pickup and drop-off locations, distance traveled, and time of day. The goal is to create a machine learning model that can accurately estimate the fare for a given taxi ride in a city, using a dataset of historical taxi rides.

## Features

**Dataset**: Historical taxi ride data, including fare amounts, pickup and drop-off locations, timestamps, passenger counts, and other relevant features.
**Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, feature engineering (e.g., calculating distances, extracting temporal features), and data normalization.
**Modeling**: Applying various machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and selecting the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Square Error).
**Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance on a test set to ensure accuracy and generalizability to unseen data.
**Deployment**: Deploying the model as a web service or API for real-time taxi fare predictions.

## Technology Stack

 **Programming Language**: Python
 **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn
**Deployment**: Flask, Docker, or FastAPI (optional)
